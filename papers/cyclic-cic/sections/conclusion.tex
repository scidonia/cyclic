\section{Conclusion and next steps}

This note collected the main ingredients of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item a CIC-like source calculus with call-by-name semantics;
\item a cyclic proof architecture: finite proof graphs + local rule correctness + global progress condition;
\item a fix-free vertex calculus produced by read-off, with explicit substitution evidence and backlinks;
\item representative transformations (\textsc{CaseCase}, head \(\beta\)-reduction, unfold/refold) whose correctness relies on semantic preservation and on transporting global progress witnesses.
\end{itemize}

Near-term extensions for a fuller paper version:
\begin{itemize}
\item complete the definitional equality / normalization rules in the vertex judgement system;
\item state and prove a generic ``witness transport'' theorem for graph rewrites;
\item relate ranking-style progress to fairness/B\"uchi-style conditions for productivity.
\end{itemize}
